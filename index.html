        <div class="left-aligned">
          <p>Hello! My name is John Finn, and I am a Middler in the D’Amore-McKim School of Business majoring in Finance and Accounting. I am from Southborough, MA and I attended St. John’s High School in Shrewsbury, MA before coming to Northeastern in the Fall of 2012. As a 3rd generation Husky (my Grandfather and Aunt are both alumni), I grew up aware of the endless opportunities available to Northeastern students in the classroom, through Co-op, and with study abroad. It’s an exciting time to be on campus, and I have enjoyed every opportunity Northeastern has provided me. I completed my first Co-op at PwC as a Tax Intern, and currently I am on Co-op as a Credit Risk Analyst at UBS Investment Bank in Stamford, CT.</p>
          <p>During my time in SGA, I have served as a Special Interest Senator for The Resident Student Association (RSA) and as the VP of Student Services. Student Services focuses on dining, housing, sustainability, campus safety, and IT issues at Northeastern. While I have tremendous pride in our school, I recognize changes students want to see in our campus life, and I believe SGA provides the tools to make those changes happen. As VP of Student Services, I devoted my time to improving Northeastern’s campus by harvesting student feedback and working with administrators to fix problems on campus. What I enjoyed most about my role was the fact that the projects and initiatives my committee and I worked on came directly from student input.</p>
          <p>Outside of SGA, I am an RA on campus and a member of RSA. I enjoy drinking coffee, eating at Stetson West, reading books about investing, and the New England Patriots.</p>

        <div class="left-aligned">
          <p>Hi! I’m Neel Desai, and I’m a sophomore Economics major with minors in Social Entrepreneurship, International Affairs, and Philosophy. I grew up in Burlington, Vermont, and have always been excited by the many opportunities at Northeastern. Last summer, I went on a dialogue to South Africa with the Social Enterprise Institute and witnessed the impact Northeastern can have on a global scale. Presently, I am on my first co-op working as an Associate Consultant at Endeavour Partners advising companies in the mobile technology industry.</p>
          <p>After my first year as a Senator for CSSH in SGA, I joined the Finance Board. It has been a great experience to work with student groups as they plan all kinds of events around campus. Shortly after, I became Vice-Chair and had the honor of helping allocate the Student Activity Fee. I am also a board member on the Student Conduct Board and sit on cases to help execute the Code of Conduct. I have learned to work effectively with the administration in this regard to keep our community safe and hold my peers to high standards.</p>
          <p>I also spend time leading a non-profit organization, Technology for Tomorrow, as President and Chairman of the Board. It is an initiative that started out during my junior year of high school with the mission to empower senior citizens to communicate more effectively with family and friends. The organization connects high schools with senior homes and have students hold workshops to teach the seniors. I have enabled the organization to secure funding from the U.S. Department of State and have worked with U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy to advance our efforts. We have been awarded for our work by Actor Kevin Spacey.</p>
          <p>Lastly, please do reach out if you ever want to chat SGA business or otherwise. Some of my interests include: House of Cards, technology, R&B, Mexican food, playing basketball, coffee, churros, hair product and traveling.</p>

        <p>Northeastern University is home to an active and engaged community, one that is ripe with opportunity for all students. Now, more than ever, is a great time to be a Husky. We want to serve the student body because we love this school. This University has come far, and opportunities for improvement still exist—this excites us.</p>
        <p>Working with our fellow students to facilitate changes that enhance their Northeastern experience should be the role of SGA at Northeastern. Northeastern students thrive when being heard, taking action, and getting results. We were both drawn to SGA because of SGA’s unique relationship with change on campus. If elected, our plan is to increase SGA’s engagement with the student body, provide an infrastructure for student-led change, and, most importantly, take action.</p>
        <h3>Engage</h3>
        <p>We want to engage and connect students with SGA through new platforms that enable discussion. We want students to feel comfortable seeking us out, and we want to listen to their ideas and perspectives. This must be an active, ongoing dialogue with the student body to advance student ideas. By combining annual initiatives, such as the budget priorities survey, and interactive content, such as online forums, Vlogs from our cabinet meetings, and committee progress podcasts, we want to share what we do with you.</p>
        <h3>Build</h3>
        <p>All change begins with a conversation. We want to be a part of that conversation early on to connect students with administrators who can help accomplish student goals. Our goal is to build the infrastructure needed to facilitate ideas and solve problems on campus. The most insightful feedback SGA receives comes from student opinion. We want to enable an open relationship with the student body at large because we truly believe more Northeastern students need to be at the table representing the complete picture of the student body.</p>
        <h3>Act</h3>
        <p>As an association, we will commit to follow through with all problems—big and small—to become an accelerator bringing student initiatives to life. At the core of our purpose is the determination to better the student experience. Every student has a different experience and wants something out of their school. We not only want to be an incubator, but an accelerator of student change. SGA exists to serve students, how can we help?</p>
        <p>Together through our experience and active engagement with Student Services, Finance Board, RSA, and the Student Conduct Board, we have worked hand-in-hand with many student leaders and administrators alike. If elected, we have the experience and insight to lead the Student Government Association. We want to empower SGA to help move your initiatives forward.</p>
        <p>We have a number of concrete, actionable changes we would like to work on as well as points of discussion we believe are important on campus. Please click here read our expansive, detailed action plan to get to work.</p>
        <p>Northeastern—we are on the cusp of something special. Let’s continue moving our university forward together. Let’s get to work.</p>
